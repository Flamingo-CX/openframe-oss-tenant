# Phase 3.2 Summary - Layout and Navigation Implementation

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Main Layout Component (✅ COMPLETED)
- Created `/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` using UI-Kit components
- Implemented responsive sidebar navigation with collapsible menu
- Added theme toggle functionality (light/dark mode)
- Integrated with authentication store for logout functionality
- Mobile-responsive with Sheet component for mobile menu

### 2. Theme Hook (✅ COMPLETED)
- Created `/src/hooks/useTheme.ts` for theme management
- Persists theme preference in localStorage
- Updates document classes and attributes for CSS theming
- Integrates with UI-Kit ODS design system

### 3. Router Configuration (✅ COMPLETED)
- Updated `/src/lib/router.tsx` to use ProtectedLayout wrapper
- All protected routes now render within MainLayout
- Module routes (MDM, RMM, RAC) properly nested with layouts
- Authentication routes remain outside the layout

### 4. TypeScript Issues Resolved (✅ COMPLETED)
- Fixed React types version mismatch between main project and UI-Kit
- Updated to @types/react@^18.3.23 and @types/react-dom@^18.3.7
- Resolved all TypeScript errors in MainLayout component
- Used simplified icons approach to avoid missing icon exports

## Key Implementation Details

### MainLayout Features
1. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Dashboard
   - Devices
   - Integrated Tools (submenu)
     - Remote Monitoring & Management
     - Remote Access and Control
     - Mobile Device Management
   - Infrastructure
   - Monitoring
   - Settings
   - SSO Configuration
   - API Keys

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Desktop: Fixed sidebar navigation
   - Mobile: Hamburger menu with slide-out Sheet
   - Consistent branding with OpenFrame logo

3. **User Actions**:
   - Theme toggle (sun/moon icons)
   - Profile navigation
   - Logout functionality

### Router Structure
```typescript
// Protected routes with layout
{
  element: <ProtectedLayout />,
  children: [
    { path: '/dashboard', element: <DashboardPage /> },
    { path: '/devices', element: <DevicesPage /> },
    // ... other routes
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps (Phase 3.2 - Core Dashboard)

### Remaining Task: Migrate SystemArchitecture.vue to DashboardPage
The Vue component at `/src/views/SystemArchitecture.vue` needs to be converted to React:

1. **Architecture Visualization**:
   - Uses Vue Flow for interactive node-based architecture diagram
   - Need to find React equivalent (React Flow or similar)
   - Shows OpenFrame services and their connections

2. **GraphQL Integration**:
   - Fetches integrated tools data
   - Filters by enabled tools
   - Dynamic node positioning based on layer and order

3. **Interactive Features**:
   - Click nodes to navigate to tools page
   - Zoom/pan controls
   - Legend for node types and connection types

## Development Server
The application is running at http://localhost:4000 with:
- API URL: http://localhost/api
- Client credentials properly configured
- Layout and navigation fully functional

## Migration Progress
- Phase 3.2 Layout: ✅ COMPLETED
- Phase 3.2 Navigation: ✅ COMPLETED
- Phase 3.2 Core Dashboard: ⏳ PENDING (SystemArchitecture migration)
