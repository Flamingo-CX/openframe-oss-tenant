# Deployment Guide

This guide covers the deployment of OpenFrame on Kubernetes. OpenFrame is designed to run as a collection of microservices in a Kubernetes environment.

## Deployment Architecture

OpenFrame on Kubernetes consists of:

1. Core Services
   - API Gateway
   - Authentication Service
   - Device Management Service
   - Monitoring Service
   - Reporting Service

2. Data Storage
   - Cassandra cluster
   - Redis cluster
   - PostgreSQL database

3. Infrastructure
   - Ingress controller
   - Service mesh
   - Monitoring stack

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Review system requirements
- [ ] Prepare Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Configure networking
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Prepare backup strategy

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy core infrastructure
- [ ] Configure services
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Configure backups
- [ ] Test connectivity

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Verify all services
- [ ] Test monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerts
- [ ] Document configuration
- [ ] Set up maintenance schedule

## Environment Configuration

```yaml
# values.yaml
global:
  environment: production
  domain: your-domain.com
  storageClass: standard

services:
  apiGateway:
    replicas: 2
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Service health endpoints
- Database connectivity
- Cache status
- API availability

### Logging
- Application logs
- System logs
- Access logs
- Error logs

### Backup and Recovery
- Database backups
- Configuration backups
- State backups
- Recovery procedures

## Security Considerations

1. Network Security
   - Network policies
   - TLS configuration
   - Service mesh security

2. Access Control
   - RBAC configuration
   - Service accounts
   - Secret management

3. Data Security
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Backup security

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Service Startup
   - Check pod logs
   - Verify configuration
   - Check dependencies

2. Performance Issues
   - Monitor resources
   - Check bottlenecks
   - Review logs

3. Connectivity Issues
   - Network configuration
   - Service discovery
   - Load balancing
