# Agent Permissions Fix Implementation

This task list outlines the plan to fix permissions issues with OpenFrame agent directories on macOS, specifically addressing PID and log directory creation and permissions. All permission handling will be done within the Rust code itself.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Identify the core issue with directory permissions
- [x] Review current directory creation logic in platform module
- [x] Determine approach to handle permissions in Rust code
- [x] Create unified directory management module
- [x] Implement robust error handling for permission issues
- [x] Add comprehensive permission validation system
- [x] Add startup directory health check
- [x] Validate directory creation and permissions in production build

## Validation Results

Directory creation and permissions have been tested and verified:

1. Logs directory (`/Library/Logs/OpenFrame/`):
   - ✓ Created successfully
   - ✓ Correct permissions (755 drwxr-xr-x)
   - ✓ Owned by root:admin

2. Application Support directory (`/Library/Application Support/OpenFrame/`):
   - ✓ Created successfully
   - ✓ Correct permissions (755 drwxr-xr-x)
   - ✓ Owned by root:admin

3. Run directory (`/Library/Application Support/OpenFrame/run/`):
   - ✓ Created successfully
   - ✓ Correct permissions (755 drwxr-xr-x)
   - ✓ Owned by root:admin

4. Log files:
   - ✓ Created successfully
   - ✓ Correct permissions (644 -rw-r--r--)
   - ✓ Owned by root:admin

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Add automated tests for directory permissions
- [ ] Create user documentation for permissions
- [ ] Implement monitoring for permission-related issues

## Known Issues

1. Tracing initialization error when running the agent
   - Error: "a global default trace dispatcher has already been set"
   - This needs to be investigated and fixed in the logging module

## Implementation Plan

### Directory Structure
The agent requires several critical directories with specific permissions:
- `/Library/Logs/OpenFrame/` (logs directory)
- `/Library/Application Support/OpenFrame/` (application data)
  - `run/` (for PID and runtime files)

### Permission Requirements
1. Logs directory: 755 (drwxr-xr-x) ✓
2. Application Support directory: 755 (drwxr-xr-x) ✓
3. Run directory: 755 (drwxr-xr-x) ✓
4. Log files: 644 (-rw-r--r--) ✓
5. PID file: 644 (-rw-r--r--) ✓
