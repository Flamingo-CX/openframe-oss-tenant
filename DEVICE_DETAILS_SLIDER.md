## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Structure

The DeviceDetailsSlider.vue component has been implemented with the following structure:
- A sidebar that slides in from the right (50% of screen width)
- A mask overlay that darkens the background when active
- A header with title that shows the device name instead of generic "Device Details"
- Action buttons positioned below the header for easy access
- Sections for different categories of device information
- Device-type specific action buttons
- Conditional rendering based on available data
- ScrollPanel for proper scrolling of content

### 2. Information Sections

The slider displays the following information categories:
- Device Overview
- Hardware Information (CPU, memory, storage, GPU)
- Network Information (IP addresses, MAC addresses, interfaces)
- Operating System Information
- Security Information (antivirus, firewall, encryption, vulnerabilities)
- Mobile Information (for MDM devices)
- Management Information
- User Information
- Software Inventory (with searchable/filterable table)

### 3. Device Actions

Different actions are available based on device type:
- MDM devices: Lock, Unlock, Erase
- RMM devices: Run Command, Reboot
- RAC devices: Remote Access, File Transfer
- All devices: Refresh, Delete

### 4. Data Visualization

Added visualization components for better data representation:
- ProgressBar for CPU usage
- ProgressBar for memory usage
- ProgressBar for disk usage
- ProgressBar for battery level
- DataTable for software inventory with filtering capability
- DataTable for vulnerabilities
- Tags for status indicators with appropriate colors

### 5. Enhanced Device Interface

The UnifiedDevice interface has been expanded to include:
- Comprehensive hardware information (CPU, memory, storage, BIOS, motherboard, GPU)
- Detailed network information (interfaces, IP addresses, MAC addresses)
- Enhanced security information (encryption, antivirus, firewall, vulnerabilities)
- Software inventory with vulnerability information
- Mobile device specifics (battery, enrollment status, profiles)
- Management information (agent versions, enrollment status)
- User information (current user, logged in users)

### 6. Responsive Design

Implemented responsive design features:
- Works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Adjustable width (90% on mobile, 75% on tablet, 50% on desktop)
- Proper scrolling for content that exceeds screen height
- Optimized grid layout that adapts to screen width

## Implementation Plan

Create a sliding panel that appears from the right side when a device is selected. The panel will display comprehensive information about the selected device, organized into logical sections. Follow the same design patterns and component structure as the ScriptExecutionHistory.vue:

1. Use sidebar with mask overlay pattern
2. Create a clean header with title and action buttons
3. Organize content with consistent spacing and styling
4. Use PrimeVue components with custom styling
5. Implement smooth transitions for panel appearance
6. Structure device information in collapsible sections
7. **Use deviceAdapters.ts for consistent device conversion across all views**
