# OpenFrame Code of Conduct

## Introduction
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors, 
users, and participants in our project. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for 
behavior and applies to all project spaces, including GitHub, community forums, social media, 
meetups, and conferences.

## Our Standards
- Be kind and respectful to others.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Show empathy towards other community members.

Prohibited behaviors include:
- Harassment, threats, or intimidation.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent content.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of 
Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, 
please notify the maintainers immediately via email or a private message on Slack/Discord 
(where available).

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces, and in public spaces when an individual 
is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email 
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an 
online or offline event.
