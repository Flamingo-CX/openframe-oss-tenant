# Fleet MDM SDK Implementation

Independent Java SDK for Fleet MDM REST API integration, providing convenient access to host information and device management.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Define SDK requirements
- [x] Determine SDK location (moved to integrated-tools/sdk/fleet-mdm-sdk/)
- [x] Create SDK structure as independent Maven module
- [x] Implement main FleetMdmClient for REST API integration
- [x] Define data models (Host with all major fields)
- [x] Implement host retrieval methods (getHosts, getHostById)
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Prepare SDK documentation (README.md with usage examples)
- [x] Make SDK independent from OpenFrame (standalone Maven project)

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Test SDK integration with openframe-stream service
- [ ] Replace FleetHostRepository with SDK usage

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add methods for other Fleet MDM operations (create, update, delete hosts)
- [ ] Implement Spring Boot integration (optional autoconfiguration)
- [ ] Add pagination support for large host lists
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create integration tests with real Fleet MDM instance
- [ ] Add support for other Fleet MDM entities (teams, policies, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core SDK (Completed)
- ✅ Create independent Maven module
- ✅ Implement FleetMdmClient with basic HTTP operations
- ✅ Define Host model with all major fields
- ✅ Add getHosts() and getHostById() methods
- ✅ Write comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Create documentation

### Phase 2: Integration (Current)
- 🔄 Integrate SDK into openframe-stream service
- 🔄 Replace existing FleetHostRepository with SDK usage
- ⏳ Test integration in real environment

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Future)
- ⏳ Add advanced features (pagination, caching, etc.)
- ⏳ Implement additional Fleet MDM API endpoints
- ⏳ Create Spring Boot starter (optional)

- `integrated-tools/sdk/fleet-mdm-sdk/TASKS.md` — This task list

## Architecture

The SDK is designed as a lightweight, dependency-free library that can be used in any Java project:

```
FleetMdmClient
├── HTTP communication (Java 11+ HttpClient)
├── JSON processing (Jackson)
├── Host model (complete Fleet MDM host representation)
└── Error handling (RuntimeException for API errors)
```

## Usage in OpenFrame Services

To use the SDK in OpenFrame services (e.g., openframe-stream):

1. Build the SDK: `cd integrated-tools/sdk/fleet-mdm-sdk && mvn clean install`
2. Add dependency to service pom.xml:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.openframe.sdk</groupId>
       <artifactId>fleet-mdm-sdk</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```
3. Replace FleetHostRepository usage with FleetMdmClient
