+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+## 1. Getting Started
+
+- Ensure you have the prerequisites installed:
+  - Java 21, Maven 3.9+, Docker & Docker Compose, Git 2.42+
+  - (Optional) Node.js + npm (for the front-end build)
+
+- Fork the repository in GitHub, then clone your fork locally:
+  ```bash
+  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/openframe.git
+  cd openframe
+  ```
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+## 2. Development Environment
+
+Below are brief steps for a standard dev environment:
+
+1. Run Maven to build the backend libraries and services:
+   ```bash
+   mvn clean install
+   ```
+2. For the front-end (if you plan to make UI changes):
+   ```bash
+   cd services/openframe-ui
+   npm install
+   npm run serve
+   ```
+3. Optionally launch the entire stack using Docker Compose:
+   ```bash
+   ./scripts/build-and-run.sh
+   ```
+
+Refer to [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for more specific setup details.
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+## 3. Code Standards and Practices
+
+- **Code style**:
+  - Use standard Java conventions, your chosen style plugin, or the project’s .editorconfig.
+  - For JavaScript/TypeScript front-end, follow Prettier/ESLint settings if available.
+
+- **Testing**:
+  - Write unit and integration tests where possible.
+  - Keep test coverage above the project threshold.
+  - For Java, we use JUnit or Testcontainers. For front-end, consider Jest or Cypress.
+
+- **Commits**:
+  - Use descriptive commit messages (e.g. “Fix login bug with JWT tokens”).
+  - Group related changes into a single commit; separate unrelated changes.
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+## 4. Pull Requests
+
+- Ensure all commits are rebased or squashed appropriately.
+- Include a clear description with:
+  - What problem you are addressing / what feature you are implementing
+  - How you tested it
+  - Any potential impacts on existing features
+- Reference the related issue if applicable (e.g., “Fixes #123”).
+- Make sure your PR passes all checks (CI, code style, test coverage).
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+## 5. Issue Tracking
+
+- Issues are tracked on the GitHub Issues page.
+- If you find a bug, please create a new issue with:
+  - Steps to reproduce
+  - Expected vs. actual results
+  - Environment details (OS, Java version, etc.)
+- For enhancements, provide a clear vision of what you’re proposing.
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+## 6. Communication
+
+- Join our official Slack/Discord for real-time discussions (links TBD).
+- Use the GitHub Discussion board for longer-form conversations.
+- Follow openframe.org blog or our social accounts for updates.
